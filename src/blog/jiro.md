# Jiro Dreams of Sushi

I just watched [Jiro Dreams of Sushi](https://www.imdb.com/es/title/tt1772925/), and I was really amazed by the quality of the documentary. I resonate highly with Jiro's philosophy and work ethic, and I think that his story is a great reminder that anyone can achieve greatness if they're willing to put in the time and effort. I think his insights are applicable to anyone in any field, not just sushi chefs.

Here's a collection of quotes from a follow-up interview with Jiro and his son, Yoshikazu. Now that everyone is trying to _cook_ at work, I think these insights are more relevant than ever.

## On Loving the Work

> You must come to love your job — otherwise, it's no good.
>
> If you start saying things like, 'I don't like this,' or 'This isn't for me,' you'll never become a master.
>
> Once you've chosen your path, you move forward. Forward, forward.
>
> Young people today — they talk like they're already masters. But when it comes to real work, they fall short. Second-rate. Third-rate.
>
> That's because machines have advanced. Everyone rushes to what's easy.
>
> But the real work — the _hand_ work — like sushi, or any craft done by hand… fewer and fewer people are doing it now. Especially the young.
>
> If they don't love it, they won't improve.

---

## On Innovation

> If something new tastes better — that's fine.
>
> But if it just _looks_ beautiful and the flavor declines, it won't last.
>
> Flavor must always come first.

He told me about octopus — _tako_.

> In the past, most people didn't like it.
>
> But I changed the way I prepared it. Improved it.
>
> And then, the people who used to say 'I hate tako' started asking for seconds.
>
> That's when you know you've got real skill.

## On Mastery

I asked: _When did you feel like a true craftsman? Like a master?_

> Around 50.

**Fifty?**

> Yes. Five-zero.
>
> Before that? You fail. Then improve. Fail again. Improve again.
>
> Around age 50, you start to finally create something close to what you have in mind.

From eight years old until 50 — did he ever want to quit?

> Never. Not once.
>
> It was never, 'Should I quit?'
>
> It was always, 'How can I get better?'

## On Family and Craft

What's it like working alongside your son all these years?

> Inside the restaurant, I don't think of him as my son.
>
> If I did, he wouldn't improve.
>
> He's a craftsman. I'm the master. Simple as that.

His son spoke up:

> I think I'm lucky. Having a teacher like this by my side.
>
> But I only started feeling that way recently.
>
> He was strict. It was tough.

How long has he been doing this?

> This is my 37th or 38th year.
>
> But I haven't even reached half his level.
>
> Every time I feel like I'm catching up, I look up…
>
> …and he's already a thousand steps ahead.

## On the Old Days

> Back then, you couldn't just say, 'I'll go here' or 'I'll quit and try that.'
>
> There were too many mouths to feed.
>
> If someone took you in, that was enough. You stayed, studied hard, and earned your place.

Did he feel competitive with his peers?

> Not 'I won't lose' — I thought, _'I will overtake them.'_

---

## On Happiness and Purpose

What brings more happiness — making sushi or making people happy?

> Being able to work is happiness.
>
> Being able to do work you _love_ — that's a higher level of happiness.
>
> It's all about accumulation.
>
> I'm still working at 90. Work is my _ikigai_ — my reason for living.

He told me about a time someone asked if he'd do something fun over a three-day holiday:

> I said, 'If I don't get to work soon, I'll die of boredom.'
>
> I'd rather be at the restaurant.

---

## On Legacy

> At 60 or 70, you've probably achieved what you aimed for.
>
> But you don't quit.
>
> You think, _What's next?_
>
> That's how humans are.

I nodded. I think I'm starting to understand.

> You're probably already thinking, 'What's next? Should I keep going?'
>
> But when you've accomplished something, the question becomes —
>
> _What else can I do?_

---

## On Struggle and Will

We talked about René Redzepi, about struggle, and stubbornness.

> You have to be strong-willed _and_ sensitive.
>
> That's how you get here.

And those at the top?

> They don't retire at 70 or 80.
>
> They tighten their belts.
>
> The next accomplishment is even closer.
>
> This will happen to you too, I bet.
>
> But if I'm alive when it does, I'll say — _See? I told you so._

## One More?

I asked if this was the end.

He laughed.

One more?  
Yes. One more.

The not-so-secret dream: to make sushi until the Tokyo Olympics.

He would be 95.

> During the last Olympics, I was already here.
>
> I want to be here for the next one, too.

**Thank you for the meal.**
