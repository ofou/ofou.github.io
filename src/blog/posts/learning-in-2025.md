# Things I want to learn in 2025

This year, my focus is on exploring the intersection of neuroscience and AI. I'll be diving deep into textbooks and hands-on projects to better understand both the human brain and artificial intelligence. The following lists outline the books, textbooks, and codebases that I'm currently reading and coding from.
