# Things I'm learning about AI in 2025

This year, my focus is on exploring the intersection of neuroscience and AI.
I'll be diving deep into textbooks and hands-on projects to better understand
both the human brain and artificial intelligence. The following lists outline
the books, textbooks that I already have in my bookshelf and plan to read, and
codebases that I'm currently reading and coding from.
