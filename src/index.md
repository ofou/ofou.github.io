# Hello, I'm Omar

I'm a Software Engineer with a passion for Artificial Intelligence (AI) and
Machine Learning (ML) who likes to turn complex ideas into practical
applications. I previously worked as a music producer, content creator for
[Neura Pod], then pivoted into AI Engineering and Developer Advocate, building
AI-powered products like [Kilo Code] coding agent, [Emergent Mind] RAG systems
for CS research, and scalable web applications for various startups. I'm
currently available for hiring, consulting, or collaboration.

## What I Do

1. _Build production-ready AI/ML products_
2. _Consulting and training in AI/ML for startups and enterprises_
3. _Create technical content from internal docs to videos_
4. _Independent research in AI, neuroscience, and machine learning_

I also enjoy [making music], contributing to [open-source] projects, learning
Mandarin (你好), and exploring new places around the world.
