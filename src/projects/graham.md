## Technical Implementation

The project leverages the RSS feed originally created by Aaron Swartz and
officially shared by Paul Graham himself, ensuring legitimate access. The
automation pipeline uses several Python libraries for clean, readable output:

- **`feedparser`** - Parses the RSS feed to retrieve essay metadata
- **`html2text`** - Converts HTML content to a clean Markdown format
- **`htmldate`** - Accurately extracts publication dates from web pages
- **`Unidecode`** - Handles character encoding for consistent text formatting

## Getting Started

#### Quick Start

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/ofou/graham-essays.git

This generates fresh EPUB and Markdown files with the latest essays.
