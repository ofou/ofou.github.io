Dear Hiring Team,

I'm writing to apply for the AI Evaluations research internship at the Existential Risk Observatory. When I first encountered the alignment problem during [specific moment/course/reading], it fundamentally changed how I think about AI development. Your organization's practical approach to reducing existential risk through concrete research outputs—especially the focus on model evaluations—is exactly where I want to contribute my skills.

**Why This Role Excites Me**

The idea of systematically probing AI models for dangerous capabilities isn't just academically interesting—it feels urgently important. I've been following the development of evaluation frameworks like AgentHarm with genuine fascination. The gap between what's been developed and what's actually been tested across different models represents both a clear research opportunity and a real safety concern. I want to help close that gap.

What particularly appeals to me about this position is the combination of technical depth and real-world impact. Building evaluation infrastructure from scratch, reproducing existing work to truly understand it, then extending it to new models—this is exactly the kind of hands-on, rigorous work I thrive on.

**My Relevant Background**

[Paragraph about your technical background - be specific with examples. For instance:]
During my [degree/work] in [field], I've developed strong Python skills through [specific project]. For example, I built [specific tool/analysis] that required [technical details]. This taught me both the importance of clean, reproducible code and how to navigate the messiness of real-world data.

My research experience in [area] has prepared me for the independent work this role requires. In [specific project], I had to [specific challenge you overcame independently]. I learned to balance perfectionism with the need to ship results, something I imagine is crucial when working on fast-moving AI safety research.

[Paragraph about quantitative skills - be concrete:]
My quantitative background includes [specific coursework/experience]. I'm comfortable with [specific statistical methods] and have used them to [specific application]. More importantly, I know when simple methods suffice and when complexity is warranted—a judgment call that seems essential for practical AI evaluation work.

**Why I'm a Good Fit**

Beyond the technical requirements, I bring:
- A genuine drive to work on AI safety (not just because it's trendy, but because [personal reason])
- The ability to write clearly about complex topics—see my [thesis/blog/project] on [topic]
- Comfort with ambiguity and the persistence to push through when things don't work the first (or fifth) time
- [Specific example of completing a difficult project]

I'm particularly drawn to your mention of potentially extending evaluations toward a "loss of control bench." The prospect of not just applying existing tools but improving them—and doing so in collaboration with others in the field—is exactly the kind of work I want to be doing.

**Practical Considerations**

I'm available to start [immediately/specific date] and strongly prefer full-time work to dive deep into this research. The hybrid arrangement works perfectly for me—I value both focused remote work and in-person collaboration. I'm [EU citizen/have work authorization] and can commit to continuing beyond the internship period if there's mutual interest.

**What I Hope to Achieve**

In this role, I aim to:
1. Quickly build a robust evaluation pipeline that can be extended by others
2. Generate genuinely useful insights about model capabilities across different systems
3. Contribute to the broader AI safety conversation through clear, compelling research outputs
4. Develop expertise that lets me contribute to AI safety long-term

I've attached my CV and [any additional materials]. I'm happy to provide code samples, discuss specific technical approaches, or share more about my background. Thank you for considering my application—I'm excited about the possibility of contributing to ERO's important work.

## Tips for Personalizing This Letter:

1. **Replace all bracketed sections** with your specific details
2. **Be concrete** - Instead of "I have experience with Python," say "I built a sentiment analysis pipeline that processed 100k tweets"
3. **Show genuine interest** - Reference specific ERO research, recent developments in AI evals, or papers you've read
4. **Keep the personal voice** - Use contractions, vary sentence length, include specific anecdotes
5. **Avoid AI-writing tells**:
   - Don't use phrases like "I am writing to express my interest"
   - Avoid perfect parallel structure in every list
   - Include some informal elements ("isn't just academically interesting")
   - Let some personality show through
6. **Length**: Aim for 1-1.5 pages when formatted properly
