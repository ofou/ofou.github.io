3. **Attention to Detail**
   - Examples of catching subtle bugs
   - Rigorous approach to research
   - Quality control in your work

## Red Flags to Avoid

1. **LLM-Generated Content** - They specifically check for this. Write naturally!
2. **Lack of Specific Examples** - Always be concrete
3. **No Demonstration of AI Safety Understanding** - Show you've thought about this
4. **Poor Writing Quality** - This is a research position; writing matters

## Interview Preparation Tips

If you get to the interview stage:

1. **Be Ready to Code**
   - Review Python basics
   - Practice with Transformers library
   - Be ready to discuss your approach to testing/evaluation

2. **Understand Their Work**
   - Read their research on existentialriskobservatory.org
   - Understand FLOP-dependent off switch concept
   - Know about Conditional AI safety treaty

3. **Evaluation Frameworks**
   - Familiarize yourself with AgentHarm
   - Look at OpenAI's evaluation sets
   - Think about how to extend existing evaluations

4. **Have Questions Ready**
   - About their research priorities
   - About the team and collaboration
   - About potential for continuing after internship

## Application Strategy

### Timeline
- Apply ASAP - they review on rolling basis
- Follow up after 1-2 weeks if no response

### Tailoring Your Application
