Dreams of Sushi</h1>
<p>I just watched <a
href="https://www.imdb.com/es/title/tt1772925/">Jiro Dreams of
Sushi</a>, and I was really amazed by the quality of the documentary. I
resonate highly with Jiro’s philosophy and work ethic, and I think that
his story is a great reminder that anyone can achieve greatness if
they’re willing to put in the time and effort. I think his insights are
applicable to anyone in any field, not just sushi chefs.</p>
<p>Here’s a collection of quotes from a follow-up interview with Jiro
and his son, Yoshikazu. Now that everyone is trying to <em>cook</em> at
work, I think these insights are more relevant than ever.</p>
<h2 id="on-loving-the-work">On Loving the Work</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>You must come to love your job — otherwise, it’s no good.</p>
<p>If you start saying things like, ‘I don’t like this,’ or ‘This isn’t
for me,’ you’ll never become a master.</p>
<p>Once you’ve chosen your path, you move forward. Forward, forward.</p>
<p>Young people today — they talk like they’re already masters. But when
it comes to real work, they fall short. Second-rate. Third-rate.</p>
<p>That’s because machines have advanced. Everyone rushes to what’s
easy.</p>
<p>But the real work — the <em>hand</em> work — like sushi, or any craft
done by hand… fewer and fewer people are doing it now. Especially the
young.</p>
<p>If they don’t love it, they won’t improve.</p>
</blockquote>
<hr />
<h2 id="on-innovation">On Innovation</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>If something new tastes better — that’s fine.</p>
<p>But if it just <em>looks</em> beautiful and the flavor declines, it
won’t last.</p>
<p>Flavor must always come first.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>He told me about octopus — <em>tako</em>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In the past, most people didn’t like it.</p>
<p>But I changed the way I prepared it. Improved it.</p>
<p>And then, the people who used to say ‘I hate tako’ started asking for
seconds.</p>
<p>That’s when you know you’ve got real skill.</p>
</blockquote>
<hr />
<h2 id="on-mastery">On Mastery</h2>
<p>I asked: <em>When did you feel like a true craftsman? Like a
master?</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Around 50.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Fifty?</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Yes. Five-zero.</p>
<p>Before that? You fail. Then improve. Fail again. Improve again.</p>
<p>Around age 50, you start to finally create something close to what
you have in mind.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>From eight years old until 50 — did he ever want to quit?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Never. Not once.</p>
<p>It was never, ‘Should I quit?’</p>
<p>It was always, ‘How can I get better?’</p>
</blockquote>
<hr />
<h2 id="on-family-and-craft">On Family and Craft</h2>
<p>What’s it like working alongside your son all these years?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Inside the restaurant, I don’t think of him as my son.</p>
<p>If I did, he wouldn’t improve.</p>
<p>He’s a craftsman. I’m the master. Simple as that.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>His son spoke up:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I think I’m lucky. Having a teacher like this by my side.</p>
<p>But I only started feeling that way recently.</p>
<p>He was strict. It was tough.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>How long has he been doing this?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This is my 37th or 38th year.</p>
<p>But I haven’t even reached half his level.</p>
<p>Every time I feel like I’m catching up, I look up…</p>
<p>…and he’s already a thousand steps ahead.</p>
</blockquote>
<hr />
<h2 id="on-the-old-days">On the Old Days</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>Back then, you couldn’t just say, ‘I’ll go here’ or ‘I’ll quit and
try that.’</p>
<p>There were too many mouths to feed.</p>
<p>If someone took you in, that was enough. You stayed, studied hard,
and earned your place.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Did he feel competitive with his peers?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Not ‘I won’t lose’ — I thought, <em>‘I will overtake them.’</em></p>
</blockquote>
<hr />
<h2 id="on-happiness-and-purpose">On Happiness and Purpose</h2>
<p>What brings more happiness — making sushi or making people happy?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Being able to work is happiness.</p>
<p>Being able to do work you <em>love</em> — that’s a higher level of
happiness.</p>
<p>It’s all about accumulation.</p>
<p>I’m still working at 90. Work is my <em>ikigai</em> — my reason for
living.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>He told me about a time someone asked if he’d do something fun over a
three-day holiday:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I said, ‘If I don’t get to work soon, I’ll die of boredom.’</p>
<p>I’d rather be at the restaurant.</p>
</blockquote>
<hr />
<h2 id="on-legacy">On Legacy</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>At 60 or 70, you’ve probably achieved what you aimed for.</p>
<p>But you don’t quit.</p>
<p>You think, <em>What’s next?</em></p>
<p>That’s how humans are.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I nodded. I think I’m starting to understand.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>You’re probably already thinking, ‘What’s next? Should I keep
going?’</p>
<p>But when you’ve accomplished something, the question becomes —</p>
<p><em>What else can I do?</em></p>
</blockquote>
<hr />
<h2 id="on-struggle-and-will">On Struggle and Will</h2>
<p>We talked about René Redzepi, about struggle, and stubbornness.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>You have to be strong-willed <em>and</em> sensitive.</p>
<p>That’s how you get here.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And those at the top?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>They don’t retire at 70 or 80.</p>
<p>They tighten their belts.</p>
<p>The next accomplishment is even closer.</p>
<p>This will happen to you too, I bet.</p>
<p>But if I’m alive when it does, I’ll say — <em>See? I told you
so.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<hr />
<h2 id="one-more">One More?</h2>
<p>I asked if this was the end.</p>
<p>He laughed.</p>
<p>One more?<br />
Yes. One more.</p>
<p>The not-so-secret dream: to make sushi until the Tokyo Olympics.</p>
<p>He would be 95.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>During the last Olympics, I was already here.</p>
<p>I want to be here for the next one, too.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Thank you for the meal.</strong></p></div>
