# Personal Website

Here's my personal website, built with [FastHTML], and [PicoCSS]. I aim for it to be a simple dynamic site with a blog, a list of projects, and an always up-to-date CV pulling data from my [LinkedIn profile]. I also plan for the site to be multilingual, supporting English, Spanish, and Mandarin.
