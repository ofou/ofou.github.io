I'm a Software Engineer with a background in Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) who like to turn complex ideas into practical applications. I previously worked as an AI Engineer and Developer Advocate, building AI-powered products such as [Kilo Code] coding agent, [Emergent Mind] RAG systems for CS research, and scalable web applications for various startups.

### What I Do

1. _Build production-ready AI solutions_
2. _Do fundamental research in the intersection of neuroscience and AI_
3. _Create technical content from docs to documentaries_

I'm passionate about the intersection of neuroscience and AI, and exploring models like brain organoids, artificial intelligence, and brain-computer interfaces to better understand cognition itself.

I also enjoy [making music], contributing to [open-source] projects, learning Mandarin (你好), and exploring new places around the world.
